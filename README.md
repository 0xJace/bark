### \*\*Disclaimer\*\*
Bark has been devolved for research and demo purposes. It is not a conventional TTS model, but instead a fully generative text-to-audio model often deviating in unexpected ways from any given script. Suno does not take responsibility for any output generated. Use at your own risk and please act responsibly.

Bark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by [Suno](https://suno.ai). Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying. To support the research community, we are providing access to pretrained model checkpoints, which are ready for inference and available for commercial use.

## 🚀 Updates

**2023.04.28**
- Bark is now licensed under the MIT License. It's now available for commercial use!
- 2x speed-up on GPU. 10x speed-up on CPU. We also added an option for a smaller version of Bark, which offers additional speed-up with the trade-off of slightly lower quality. 
- You can now use Bark with GPUs that have low VRAM (<4GB). 
- We created a prompt library, which you can find [here](https://suno-ai.notion.site/9c5b93f57ece4e68b54808bce7b72fc8?v=89c0127caf9b4892ad1828fd467dcfff). We hope this resource will help you find useful prompts for your use cases! You can also join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/J2B2vsjKuE), where the community actively shares and discusses prompts in the **#audio-prompts** channel.  
- We created tutorials folders - including guides for long-form generation, removing background noise and voice consistency enhancements.  

## 🐍 Usage in Python

<details>
  <summary>🪑 Basics</summary>
<br>

```python
from bark import SAMPLE_RATE, generate_audio, preload_models
from scipy.io.wavfile import write as write_wav
from IPython.display import Audio

# download and load all models
preload_models()

# generate audio from text
text_prompt = """
     Hello, my name is Suno. And, uh — and I like pizza. [laughs] 
     But I also have other interests such as playing tic tac toe.
"""
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)

# save audio to disk
write_wav("/path/to/audio.wav", SAMPLE_RATE, audio_array)
  
# play text in notebook
Audio(audio_array, rate=SAMPLE_RATE)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🌎 Foreign Language</summary>
<br>
Bark supports various languages out-of-the-box and automatically determines language from input text. When prompted with code-switched text, Bark will attempt to employ the native accent for the respective languages. English quality is best for the time being, and we expect other languages to further improve with scaling. 
<br>
<br>

```python

text_prompt = """
    추석은 내가 가장 좋아하는 명절이다. 나는 며칠 동안 휴식을 취하고 친구 및 가족과 시간을 보낼 수 있습니다.
"""
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)
```

*Note: since Bark recognizes languages automatically from input text, it is possible to use for example a german history prompt with english text. This usually leads to english audio with a german accent.*

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🎶 Music</summary>
<br>
Bark can generate all types of audio, and, in principle, doesn't see a difference between speech and music. Sometimes Bark chooses to generate text as music, but you can help it out by adding music notes around your lyrics.
<br>
<br>

```python
text_prompt = """
    ♪ In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion barks tonight ♪
"""
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)
```
[lion.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5068315/230684766-97f5ea23-ad99-473c-924b-66b6fab24289.webm)
</details>

<details>
<summary>🎤 Voice Presets and Voice/Audio Cloning</summary>
<br>
Bark has the capability to fully clone voices - including tone, pitch, emotion and prosody. The model also attempts to preserve music, ambient noise, etc. from input audio. However, to mitigate misuse of this technology, we limit the audio history prompts to a limited set of Suno-provided, fully synthetic options to choose from for each language. Specify following the pattern: `{lang_code}_speaker_{0-9}`.
<br>
<br>

```python
text_prompt = """
    I have a silky smooth voice, and today I will tell you about 
    the exercise regimen of the common sloth.
"""
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt, history_prompt="en_speaker_1")
```

## 💻 Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/suno-ai/bark
cd bark && pip install . 
```
*Note: Do NOT use 'pip install bark'. It installs a different package, which is not managed by Suno.*


## 🛠️ Hardware and Inference Speed

Bark has been tested and works on both CPU and GPU (`pytorch 2.0+`, CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 12.0).
On modern GPUs and PyTorch nightly, Bark can generate audio in roughly realtime. On older GPUs, default colab, or CPU, inference time might significantly slower. For older GPUs or CPU you might want to consider using smaller models. Details can be found in out tutorial sections here.

If you don't have new hardware available or if you want to play with bigger versions of our models, you can also sign up for early access to our model playground [here](https://3os84zs17th.typeform.com/suno-studio).

## ⚙️ Details

Bark is fully generative tex-to-audio model devolved for research and demo purposes. It follows a GPT style architecture similar to [AudioLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143) and [Vall-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111) and a quantized Audio representation from [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec). It is not a conventional TTS model, but instead a fully generative text-to-audio model capable of deviating in unexpected ways from any given script. Different to previous approaches, the input text prompt is converted directly to audio without the intermediate use of phonemes. It can therefore generalize to arbitrary instructions beyond speech such as music lyrics, sound effects or other non-speech sounds.

Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well on [Discord](https://discord.gg/J2B2vsjKuE)!

- `[laughter]`
- `[laughs]`
- `[sighs]`
- `[music]`
- `[gasps]`
- `[clears throat]`
- `—` or `...` for hesitations
- `♪` for song lyrics
- capitalization for emphasis of a word
- `MAN/WOMAN:` for bias towards speaker

## 🎧 Suno Studio (Early Access)

We’re developing a playground for our models, including Bark. 

If you are interested, you can sign up for early access [here](https://3os84zs17th.typeform.com/suno-studio).

## FAQ

#### How do I specify where models are downloaded and cached?

Use the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` env variable to override where models are downloaded and cached (otherwise defaults to a subdirectory of `~/.cache`).

#### Bark's generations sometimes differ from my prompts. What's happening?

Bark is a GPT-style model. As such, it may take some creative liberties in its generations, resulting in higher-variance model outputs than traditional text-to-speech approaches.

#### Voice Cloning 

#### VRAM 

#### Metallic Hollow Sound
